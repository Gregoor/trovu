# I Edited a Shortcut, but It Has No Effect

This might be a caching issue.

First of all, make sure that GitHub has updated the raw version of the shortcut file you edited. Click on the “raw” button and keep refreshing the page until you see your changes.

Second, clear your browser cache. There are extensions that make this easy, such as [Clear Cache](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/clearcache/) for Firefox or [Clear Cache](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/clear-cache/cppjkneekbjaeellbfkmgnhonkkjfpdn) for Chrome.
