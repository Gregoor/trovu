- country namespaces are not 3-letter but 2-letter-codes, prefixed with a dot, e.g.
  - `.de`, not `deu`
- search queries are not sent out to the server / all processing is done in the client, not on the server (more privacy)
- for user shortcuts, users need to host them themselves. This can be done easily with a Github repository for instance. To get started
  - fork [trovu-data-user](https://github.com/trovu/trovu-data-user)
  - from [trovu-data-user-legacy](https://github.com/trovu/trovu-data-user-legacy), copy the shortcuts from your directory into your newly forked `trovu-data-user`.
