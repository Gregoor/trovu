# shortcut.tags

Tags allow for the grouping of shortcuts. Unlike [namespaces](namespaces.md), tags do not affect the precedence of shortcuts.

## Special Tags

However, certain tags will alter the way shortcuts are displayed in suggestions.

### `is-affiliate`

Shortcuts tagged with `is-affiliate` are created in partnership with the destination websites, and we receive a commission when users make purchases through these links, with no extra cost to the users. This process is known as [Affiliate marketing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affiliate_marketing).

For example, the Amazon shortcut is an affiliate link: when you use it and make a purchase, Trovu earns a small percentage of the sale.

Affiliate shortcuts enable us to generate revenue without disrupting the user experience.

### `needs-userscript`

To use shortcuts tagged with `needs-userscript`, please ensure that the [userscript](userscripts.md) is installed for them to work correctly.
