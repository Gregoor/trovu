- *Main difference*: search queries are not sent out to the server, all processing is done in the client.
  - Thus, your search queries remain private.
  - Instead in a database, shortcuts are kept in [YAML files](https://github.com/trovu/trovu.github.io/wiki#trovu-data).
- If you have personal **user shortcuts**, you host them on [your Github account](https://github.com/trovu/trovu.github.io/wiki/Advanced-settings-&-personal-shortcuts) (see also Migration below).
- country namespaces are not 3-letter but 2-letter-codes, prefixed with a dot, e.g.
  - `.de`, not `deu`

If you are using FindFind.it with an account and have personal shortcuts and settings, you can [[migrate them to Trovu|Migrate from FindFind.it]].

Without an account, simply set up [[trovu on your device|Use Trovu on your device]].
